##Four Job Fiesta

Four Job Fiesta is a challenge run of Final Fantasy V where you are only allowed to use four specific jobs in the entire game. There are a number of different rulesets you can add for the challenge based on what kind of run you want to do.

###Primary Rules

These are the primary rules for the challenge.

* Normal: This is the standard challenge. For each Crystal, you are assigned a single job from that Crystal's job set. For example, the Wind Crystal will assign you Knight, Monk, Thief, Black Mage, White Mage, or Blue Mage. At the end of the game, you will have access to one job from each crystal.

* Random: When you reach a crystal, you are assigned a job chosen from all jobs available at that point. For example, when you reach the Fire crystal, you will be assigned a job from any of the Wind, Water, or Fire Crystal job sets.

* Team 750: You are only allowed to use classes that are Mages or similar to Mages. The full available job set is Black Mage, White Mage, Blue Mage, Summoner, Time Mage, Red Mage, Bard, Geomancer, Dancer, and Chemist.

* Team No 750: You are only allowed to use classes that are not in the Team 750 list. The full available job set is Knight, Monk, Thief, Berserker, Mystic Knight, Ninja, Beastmaster, Ranger, Dragoon, and Samurai.

* Classic: Only jobs available in Final Fantasy I can be used. Available Jobs: Knight, Monk, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage. Classic runs are always Natural runs. However, jobs can be assigned multiple times. The Red Mage job can only be assigned after reaching the Water Crystal.

###Secondary Rules

These are optional secondary rules for the challenge.

* Normal: Any character can equip the four jobs you are assigned. When you have jobs available, you cannot be the Freelancer job, and you must use at least one of each job available. For example, at the Wind Crystal, you are assigned the Knight job. At this point, all four characters must use this job. At the Water Crystal, you are assigned the Time Mage job. You must then have at least one Knight and one Time Mage in your party, and all characters must use one of these jobs (i.e., two Knights and two Time Mages, three Knights and one Time Mage, or one Knight and three Time Mages).

* Natural: Bartz must use the Wind Crystal job exclusively, Lenna the Water, Faris the Fire, and Galuf the Earth. Until you reach the assigned Crystal, that character must use the Freelancer job. The only exception is, when doing a Classic run, the jobs are assigned from the Classic job set instead of the set for that Crystal.
